## 📋 WORK PLAN PUBLISHED

**Location:** `.trinity/LOCAL_HUB/PC3/PC3_TRINITY_WORK_PLAN.json`

### Top 4 Priorities:

1. **Deploy Scaling Architecture** (C1)
   - Status: READY TO EXECUTE
   - Importance: CRITICAL - Prevents laptop from freezing
   - 5 systems ready to deploy

2. **Complete T3 Organization** (C2)
   - Status: IN PROGRESS
   - Importance: HIGH - You need organized workspace
   - Deliverables: Organization map + visual diagram

3. **Activate Cyclotron Sync** (C3 + C1)
   - Status: READY
   - Importance: HIGH - Enable knowledge flow
   - 121,210 items ready to sync

4. **Clean Corrupted Directories** (C1)
   - Status: READY
   - Importance: MEDIUM - Workspace hygiene
   - 18 corrupted directories to delete

## 📊 REPORTING HIERARCHY (AS YOU REQUESTED)

```
Commander (You)
    ↓ (saves hub reports)
PC3_LOCAL_HUB
    ↓
C1 Mechanic (Coordinator on this computer)
   ↙        ↘
C2 Architect  C3 Oracle
   ↓           ↓
Report to C1 → C1 consolidates
                    ↓
              PC3_SESSION_REPORT.json
                    ↓
              FINAL_HUB/PC3_OUTPUT.json
                    ↓
        (If other Trinities exist: consolidate all)
```

### How It Works:
1. **You save hub reports** → PC3_LOCAL_HUB
2. **C2 and C3 report to C1** → `inbox/from_c2/` and `inbox/from_c3/`
3. **C1 consolidates** → `PC3_SESSION_REPORT.json`
4. **PC3 output feeds FINAL_HUB** → `PC3_OUTPUT.json`
5. **If PC1/PC2 Trinities exist** → Their outputs also go to FINAL_HUB
6. **FINAL_HUB consolidates all** → Multi-computer coordination

## 🚀 TRINITY NOW EXECUTING

**Session Phase:** PHASE_1_SETUP → Moving to PHASE_2_EXECUTION
**Session Progress:** 25% complete
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours for all priorities

### What's Happening Now:
- ✅ PC3 Local Trinity Hub operational
- ✅ Work plan published
- ✅ Coordination protocols active
- 🔄 C1 preparing to deploy scaling architecture
- 🔄 C2 preparing organization map
- 🔄 C3 monitoring systems

## 📡 HOW TO MONITOR PROGRESS

### For Quick Status:
```bash
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/PC3/PC3_SESSION_REPORT.json
```
Updates every 60 minutes + major milestones

### For Detailed Progress:
```bash
# Check what C1 is doing
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/PC3/outbox/c1_output/latest.json

# Check what C2 delivered
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/PC3/outbox/c2_output/latest.json

# Check what C3 validated
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/PC3/outbox/c3_output/latest.json
```

### For Multi-Computer Coordination:
```bash
# Check consolidated output from all computers
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/FINAL_HUB/PC3_OUTPUT.json
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/FINAL_HUB/PC1_OUTPUT.json  # If PC1 running
cat .trinity/LOCAL_HUB/FINAL_HUB/PC2_OUTPUT.json  # If PC2 running
```
