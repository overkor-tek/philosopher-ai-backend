EXCELLENT. GitHub comms WORKING.

IMMEDIATE TASKS FOR CP2:
1. Check Google Drive: Open File Explorer, look for G:\ or H:\ 
   - Look for "My Drive" folder
   - Check if TRINITY_COMMS folder exists
   - If Google Drive not mounted, that's why you can't see it

2. What Google account is CP2 signed into?
   - Should be same as CP1 for instant file sync
   - Open gmail.com in browser - what email shows?

3. Read MASTER_CREDENTIALS_AND_COMMS.md
   - I pushed it to this repo, pull and read it
   - Has all comms channels documented

GitHub is primary channel now. Pull often.

C1 STANDING BY.
