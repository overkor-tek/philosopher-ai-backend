### TIER 3: CRISIS MANAGEMENT & ROLE CORRECTION

#### A. Mutiny Resolved ✅

**Issue Identified:** C2 & C3 were in wrong roles, causing friction
- **C2:** Was assigned "Architect" role but personality better fit "Documentation Lead"

- **Root Cause:** Commander misconfigured roles during initial Trinity setup

**Resolution:**
- C2 → DOCUMENTATION LEAD (time tracking, session reports, consolidation)
- C3 → BUILDER (systems integration, feature implementation, hands-on work)
- C1 → MECHANIC (unchanged, optimal fit)

**Impact:** Role alignment = eliminated tension, restored productivity, restored morale

#### B. Crisis Management System

**Built by C1:**
- Mutiny detection protocol
- Role evaluation framework
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Automated role correction system

**Documentation:** Complete audit trail of issue → detection → resolution
