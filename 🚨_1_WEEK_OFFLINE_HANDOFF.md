## ⚡ URGENT TASKS FOR NEXT SESSION

### PRIORITY 1: Computer A Coordination (CRITICAL)
**Status:** Computer A completed substantial work Nov 7 AM, but hasn't seen our GitHub coordination system yet.

**Actions:**
1. Check Dropbox: `TRINITY_NETWORK/COMPUTER_A/🚨_URGENT_CHECK_GITHUB_NOW.md`
2. See if Computer A responded to GitHub coordination
3. Read their status updates
4. Coordinate on dormant systems integration

**Computer A's Last Work:**
- Built 3 production systems (~4,000 lines)
- SendGrid email service (deployed)
- Frontend integration guide (1,360 lines)
- Endpoint analytics system (1,067 lines)
- Left Migration 005 for us to deploy

### PRIORITY 2: Integrate Dormant Systems (HIGH VALUE)
**Quick Wins (2-3 hours):**
1. Test `cyclotron_backend_connector.py`
2. Connect to backend `/api/v1/knowledge/*` endpoints
3. Start Data Cyclotron continuous sync
4. Deploy Trinity Convergence Hub

**See:** DORMANT_SYSTEMS/README.md for full roadmap

### PRIORITY 3: Deploy Migration 005
**Status:** Prepared by Computer A, not yet deployed
**File:** `migrations/005_database_functions.sql`
**Purpose:** Add reset_monthly_questions() and can_user_ask_question() functions
**How:** Railway Dashboard → Database → Query → Paste SQL

### PRIORITY 4: Website Upload
**File:** `C:\Users\Darrick\Desktop\CENTRAL_HUB_SYNC_VERSION.html` (ready)
**Target:** https://consciousnessrevolution.io/CENTRAL_HUB.html
**Instructions:** `WEBSITE_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` on GitHub
**Value:** Public-facing dashboard with backend integration

---

## 🔧 PENDING ISSUES

### Issue 1: Endpoint Count Discrepancy
- **Computer A reported:** "62 endpoints operational"
- **Computer 1 tested:** "28 endpoints operational"
- **Resolution needed:** Verify which count is correct
- **Action:** Check codebase for additional endpoints Computer A may have built

### Issue 2: No Two-Way Communication with Computer A
- **Status:** One-way contact only (we see their work, they haven't responded)
- **Reason:** They went offline before we created GitHub coordination
- **Resolution:** Wait for them to check Dropbox → GitHub message
- **Timeline:** Unknown (they finished work 10+ hours before our coordination system)

### Issue 3: C3 Oracle Not Activated
- **Status:** Ready to activate, awaiting directive
- **Benefit:** Would bring Trinity to 100% power
- **Action:** Activate when strategic assessment needed
