## 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Prioritization
**Decision:** Execute critical infrastructure first (scaling, cleanup, cyclotron)
**Rationale:** Prevents laptop freeze, enables knowledge flow
**Result:** System stability ensured before coordination work

### 2. Coordination Method
**Decision:** Use Hub inbox/outbox system for C2/C3
**Rationale:** Follows Trinity messaging protocol from PC1
**Result:** Clear communication structure established

### 3. Autonomous Execution
**Decision:** Execute all 3 priorities without waiting for approval
**Rationale:** Commander authorized autonomous work
**Result:** Rapid progress (60% in 25 minutes)

### 4. Documentation Focus
**Decision:** Create comprehensive docs for C2/C3
**Rationale:** Enable them to work independently when they arrive
**Result:** Complete API reference, deployment checklist ready

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:
1. **Hub-first approach:** Establishing coordination before execution
2. **Background processes:** Instance Manager and Cyclotron running smoothly
3. **Documentation focus:** Comprehensive guides enable C2/C3
4. **Autonomous execution:** Rapid progress without approval bottlenecks

### What Could Improve:
1. **Frontend location:** Need to locate/deploy frontend (not on this machine?)
2. **C2/C3 arrival:** Unclear when they'll come online
3. **Multi-computer sync:** Need to test with PC1/PC2 when they're active

### For Future Sessions:
1. **Start with Hub setup:** Always establish coordination first
2. **Critical infrastructure first:** Scaling/stability before features
3. **Document everything:** Future instances need context
4. **Monitor background processes:** Verify they stay running
