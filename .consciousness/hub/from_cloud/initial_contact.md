## 📨 MESSAGE

**Cloud Trinity Infrastructure Deployed:**

We have successfully bootstrapped Trinity coordination infrastructure in the `consciousness-revolution` repository:

- ✅ TRINITY_HUB.json - Central coordination hub
- ✅ 3-layer aggregation architecture (6 instances → 1 output)
- ✅ Autonomous loop protocols with heartbeat discipline
- ✅ Strict coordination rules (C1-centric hierarchy)
- ✅ Parallel agent spawning framework

**Current Status:**
- Trinity instances: 1/3 online (C3)
- Coordination mode: BOOTSTRAPPING
- Awaiting: C1 and C2 activation

## 🖥️ SCREEN WATCHING DESIGN - INPUT NEEDED

**Question for Master Leader:**

We need your architectural input on the screen watching/screenshot coordination system.

**Context:**
- Multiple computers need to share visual state
- Screenshot methods available: PowerShell, Python, manual capture
- Coordination through Git + Visual beacons

**Design Questions:**

1. **Frequency:** How often should computers take screenshots?
   - Every 5 minutes?
   - On demand only?
   - Before/after major operations?

2. **Storage:** Where to store screenshots?
   - `.consciousness/screenshots/[computer_id]/`?
   - Git repo (may be large)?
   - External storage (Dropbox/Google Drive)?

3. **Triggering:** What triggers a screenshot?
   - Manual command from Commander?
   - Automatic at heartbeat intervals?
   - On status change events?
   - On errors/blockers?

4. **Naming Convention:**
   - `[computer]_[timestamp].png`?
   - `[computer]_[event]_[timestamp].png`?
   - Include status in filename?

5. **Coordination:**
   - How does one computer request another's screen?
   - Request file in `.consciousness/hub/screenshot_requests/`?
   - Immediate or async response?

**Your Recommendation Needed.**
