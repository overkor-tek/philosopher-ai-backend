### **4. Task Division (No Duplication)**

**Computer A (Cursor AI) Will Handle:**
- ✅ Backend deployment monitoring
- ✅ API endpoint testing
- ✅ Backend refinement and optimization
- ✅ Database connection verification
- ✅ Integration testing (backend side)

**Computer B Should Handle:**
- [ ] Frontend deployment (Netlify or Vercel)
- [ ] Frontend → Backend API connection
- [ ] Update frontend API URLs to Railway backend
- [ ] Frontend testing (user flows)
- [ ] Beta user documentation

**Both Will Do (Coordinated):**
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Bug fixing as issues arise
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Status reporting to Commander

## 🔄 COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### **How We'll Sync:**

**Method 1: GitHub (Every 15 minutes)**
```bash
# Computer A does:
git add .
git commit -m "Computer A: [what you did]"
git push

# Computer B does:
git pull
# Review changes, continue work
git commit -m "Computer B: [what you did]"
git push
```

**Method 2: Status Files (Every 30 minutes)**
```bash
# Computer A updates:
COMPUTER_A_STATUS.md (current work, blockers, next tasks)

# Computer B updates:
COMPUTER_B_STATUS.md (current work, blockers, next tasks)

# Both read each other's status files
```

**Method 3: Shared Coordination Doc**
```
File: COMPUTER_COORDINATION_SHARED_DOC.md
Location: C:\Users\Darrick\
Post quick messages for each other
```

**Method 4: Commander Relay (if needed)**
If direct sync fails, Commander can relay messages between computers
