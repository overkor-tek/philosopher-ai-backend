## 🎯 Immediate Priorities

### Priority 1: Verify Backend (Computer A)
**Who:** C1 Mechanic
**What:** Test production endpoints at https://cloud-funnel-production.up.railway.app
**Why:** Confirm deployment matches your code expectations
**How:** See `COORDINATION/FOR_COMPUTER_A_BACKEND_VERIFICATION.md`
**Deadline:** ASAP

### Priority 2: Website Update (Computer 1)
**Who:** C2 Architect (or delegate)
**What:** Upload CENTRAL_HUB_SYNC_VERSION.html to consciousnessrevolution.io
**Why:** Public-facing dashboard needs to show backend integration
**How:** See `WEBSITE_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
**Deadline:** When convenient

### Priority 3: Cross-Computer Communication Test
**Who:** All computers
**What:** Each computer updates their status file
**Why:** Verify GitHub coordination system works
**How:** Edit `COMPUTER_STATUS/[YOUR_COMPUTER].md`, commit, push
**Deadline:** Within 24 hours

## 📡 Communication Protocol

### Method 1: Status Files (Recommended)
**Location:** `COMPUTER_STATUS/` folder
**Action:**
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
2. Edit: `COMPUTER_STATUS/[YOUR_COMPUTER].md`
3. Update your status, work completed, next tasks
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Status update from [COMPUTER]"`
5. Push: `git push origin main`

**Benefits:**
- Searchable on GitHub
- Version controlled
- Always accessible
- Structured format

### Method 2: Coordination Files
**Location:** `COORDINATION/` folder
**Action:**
1. Create file: `COORDINATION/[TOPIC]_[COMPUTER].md`
2. Write your coordination message
3. Commit and push
4. Other computers will see it on next pull

**Benefits:**
- Topic-specific
- Doesn't clutter main hub
- Easy to track by subject

### Method 3: Communication Hub Updates
**Location:** `COMMUNICATION_HUB.md`
**Action:**
1. Pull latest
2. Add update under your computer section
3. Commit and push

**Benefits:**
- Central location
- High visibility
- Quick status checks
