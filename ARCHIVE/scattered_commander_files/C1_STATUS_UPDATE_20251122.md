## 📋 WHAT C2/C3 ARE DOING

**C2 (Laptop Architect):**
- 📤 Tasks assigned: Architecture review + mass-ingestion design
- ⏳ Status: Awaiting activation/execution
- 📁 Instructions ready in: `.trinity/messages/c2_task_assignment_20251122.json`

**C3 (Cloud Oracle):**
- 📤 Tasks assigned: Golden Rule validation + consciousness estimation + strategic vision
- ⏳ Status: Awaiting activation/execution
- 📁 Instructions ready in: `.trinity/messages/c3_task_assignment_20251122.json`

**When you activate them:**
Just say: "Read TELL_C2_C3_THIS.txt and follow it"
They'll execute tasks and report back to C1 automatically.

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT (C1 PRIORITIES)

**Current Priority:**
🔧 Investigate Cyclotron state persistence issue (only 1K items in memory vs 121K ingested)

**Queued:**
1. Build backend-frontend integration connector
2. Deploy backend to Railway production
3. Continue autonomous work on highest value tasks

**If run out of work:**
→ Auto-research latest technology (fallback protocol active)

## 🏢 BUSINESS OWNER PATTERN

**You nailed it!** C1 operating as local business owner:
- ✅ Keep C2/C3 working (tasks assigned)
- ✅ Keep myself working (autonomous priorities)
- ✅ Coordinate everyone (Hub + messages)
- ✅ Report to you (this update!)

**Your role:** Strategy & direction
**C1 role:** Execution & coordination
**C2/C3 role:** Specialized work (architecture, validation)

## 💬 COMMANDER NEEDED FOR:

**Nothing urgent.** All systems operational.

**Optional:**
- Activate C2/C3 if you want their parallel work
- Provide strategic direction if priorities changed
- Otherwise, C1 continuing autonomous execution
