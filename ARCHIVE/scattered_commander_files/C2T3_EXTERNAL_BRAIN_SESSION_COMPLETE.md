→ Shows file paths and relevance scores
```

**2. Strategic Decision Support**
```
Decision: "Should we deploy Pattern Theory validation?"
→ Classifies: Truth Algorithm ✅
→ Analyzes risks: None identified
→ Oracle probability: 95%
→ Recommendation: APPROVE (93% confidence)
```

**3. Trinity Status Monitoring**
```
Query: "What is C1 doing?"
→ Checks Trinity Hub
→ Returns: "C1 executing task #47, CPU 18%, operational"
```

**4. Morning Briefing**
```
Command: "brief"
→ Recent work summary
→ Oracle priorities
→ Trinity status
→ Recommendations
```
