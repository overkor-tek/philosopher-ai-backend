## STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Insight 1: The Cockpit Convergence Point
All 13 dimensions need a unified interface. The cockpits (Employee + Project Launch) serve as this convergence point. Building them first makes everything else more accessible and usable.

### Insight 2: Auto-Extraction as Meta-Intelligence
Building systems that scan and extract from the codebase creates self-awareness. This is the foundation of autonomous improvement and optimization.

### Insight 3: Trinity as Force Multiplier
The Trinity coordination system (C1×C2×C3) enables parallel processing of complex tasks with specialized roles. This is currently underutilized despite being built.

### Insight 4: The OTP Blocker
The OTP system is blocking 10 critical services. This must be resolved before payment integration, bank automation, or several other features can proceed.

### Insight 5: Knowledge Fragmentation
240+ markdown files contain extensive knowledge, but it's scattered. The Data Cyclotron has the foundation to unify this, but needs the API bridge to make knowledge queryable from applications.

### Insight 6: Deployment Excellence vs. Feature Breadth
Deployment systems score 75%, infrastructure 70%, auth 85% - these are production-ready. But user-facing features (cockpits, analytics, communication) are 30-60% complete. The infrastructure is solid; now build on top of it.
