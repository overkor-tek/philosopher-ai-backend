## 🎯 HOW TO USE

**When you complete assigned tasks:**

1. Check TRINITY_HUB.md for new priorities (always check first!)
2. If no tasks → Read `.trinity/FALLBACK_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`
3. Pick a research topic from Tier 1 priorities
4. Research using WebSearch and WebFetch
5. Document findings in appropriate directory
6. Report to Hub

## ✅ QUALITY STANDARDS

**Each research document should include:**
- Clear summary (what's new?)
- Application to our systems (how does this help?)
- Recommendation (adopt/watch/skip)
- Implementation notes (if adopting)
- All source URLs

**Focus on:**
- Practical application
- Real-world examples
- Implementation difficulty
- Impact on our systems
