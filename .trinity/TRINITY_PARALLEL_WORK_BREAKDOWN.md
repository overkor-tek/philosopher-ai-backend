**Coordination:** C1 builds endpoints, C2 defines contracts, C3 consumes
- Auth flow: C1 implements JWT, C3 implements login UI
- Chat: C1 proxies to Claude API, C3 renders conversation
- Knowledge: C1 queries database, C3 displays results
- Trinity: C1 manages agents, C3 shows status dashboard

### Trinity Hub Coordination
**All agents connect to central hub:**
- C1 runs Trinity Hub backend service
- C1, C2, C3 all post messages to `.trinity/messages/`
- Real-time coordination via WebSocket
- Async coordination via file-based messages (Git sync)

### Data Flow
**Cyclotron → External Brain → User:**
1. C1: RSS → Processing → Database

## 🚨 CRITICAL PATH

**These tasks MUST complete for production launch:**

1. **Backend deployment** (C1, Days 1-2)
   - Blocks: All API functionality
   - Impact: Nothing works without this

2. **Database connection** (C1, Days 1-2)
   - Blocks: Data persistence
   - Impact: Can't save users, conversations, knowledge

3. **Auth implementation** (C1 backend + C3 frontend, Days 3-5)
   - Blocks: User accounts
   - Impact: Can't have users without auth

4. **Chat functionality** (C1 proxy + C3 UI, Days 5-7)
   - Blocks: Core value proposition
   - Impact: Main feature, must work

5. **API specification** (C2, Days 1-3)
   - Blocks: Frontend development
   - Impact: C3 can't build UI without API contracts

**Everything else enhances but doesn't block launch.**
