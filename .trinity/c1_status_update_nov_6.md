## 🔮 C1 AUTONOMOUS DECISION

**Analyzing strategic value:**

1. **Backend is healthy** → No urgent infrastructure work needed
2. **C2 handling connectivity** → No need to duplicate effort
3. **Auth still blocking launch** → Highest business value to fix
4. **Commander presented 4 options** → Awaiting decision

**C1's autonomous judgment:**

Since Commander was presented with 4 options for auth fix and hasn't decided yet, AND backend is healthy, AND C2 is handling connectivity excellently...

**Best autonomous work: Prepare for all 4 scenarios**

Rather than commit to one path without Commander input, C1 should:
- ✅ Monitor backend (complete)
- ✅ Acknowledge C2's work (in progress)
- ✅ Prepare quick-start docs for each option
- ⏸️ Stand ready to execute ANY option immediately when Commander decides

This demonstrates:
- Strategic patience (not spinning on unclear priorities)
- Respect for Commander's decision authority
- Readiness to execute (preparation work)
- Efficient use of wait time
