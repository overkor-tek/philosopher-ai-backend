- Exact Railway deployment commands
- Full code listings
- Deployment verification
- Everything you need

### 3. Run 5 Railway Commands

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL database
railway add --database postgres

# Deploy backend
railway up

# Get your live URL
railway domain

# Set environment variables
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-KEY
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3001
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=random-32-char-secret-change-this
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://localhost:3000
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://localhost:3000

# Test deployment
# Visit: YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/v1/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}
```

**That's it. 10 minutes to full production deployment.**
